    !--Section_1_Introduction--!
        !--BSL--!
        <string name="intro_title">What is BSL?</string>
        <string name="intro_para1">You may already know something about sign language, but as with learning any new language, it can be useful to have at least a basic understanding of the history and culture that surrounds it.
            In this section there is a very brief background of sign language, please read it carefully.</string>
        <string name="intro_para2">Sign Language is a visual form of communicating using a combination of hand shapes, spatial representation, gestures, facial expression, and body language.
            Sign Language is used mainly by Deaf people and people with hearing difficulties and has been used as a method of communication among Deaf people for hundreds of years.</string>
        <string name="intro_para3"> British Sign Language, known as BSL, is the main form of sign language used within the UK and has been recognised by the UK government as a minority language since 2003.
            BSL is an independent language which is separate to spoken English, having its own grammar and syntax. It is estimated that BSL is used by around 151,000 people within the UK.</string>

        !--D/DeafPeople--!
        <string name="deaf_title">D/Deaf People</string>
        <string name="deaf_para1">It is useful when learning BSL to understand a bit about the Deaf world.  Deaf people (with an upper-case D) are people who have had a profound hearing loss since birth and have been raised
            and identify as part of the Deaf community. Deaf people usually consider BSL to be their first language and generally socialise mainly within the Deaf community.</string>
        <string name="deaf_para2">Within the Deaf world there is a lot of pride for the language and culture and many Deaf people do not see their deafness as a disability, but as just another characteristic of who they are, just
            as they might have black hair or brown eyes. For Deaf people the word Deaf is a mark of cultural identity, much like the words English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish (etc.) rather than just a label of someone who cannot hear.</string>
        <string name="deaf_para3">A deaf person (with a lower-case d) refers to somebody who has lost their hearing after they were born and/or were brought up in the hearing community. A deaf person will typically socialise in both
            the hearing and Deaf communities.</string>

        !--Audism--!
        <string name="aud_title">Audism</string>
        <string name="aud_para1">Audism is an attitude whereby people who are hearing sometimes hold a negative stigma towards those who are unable to hear - similar to sexism or racism.
            Audism assumes a limit on the abilities of what a person who is Deaf can do. Audist attitudes are most often held by those who are hearing.
            These attitudes are sometimes seen in those who are learning sign language and may think they are trying to be helpful. </string>
    <string name="aud_para2"><b>Examples of audist behaviors include:</b></string>
        <string name="aud_1">- Trying to assist with communication without being asked.</string>
        <string name="aud_2">- Asking someone to write down or lipread without them requesting this as their preferred communication method.</string>
        <string name="aud_3">- Making a phone call on behalf of someone because you assume they are unable to.</string>
        <string name="aud_para3">These are but a few examples of audist behaviours. When you are communicating with other BSL users make sure you are doing so as equals - think about how you are behaving and think carefully about whether
            your actions could be seen as audist, even though you are not intending them to be. </string>

        !--PrimaryHand--!
        <string name="prim_title">Your Primary Hand</string>
        <string name="prim_para1">When you are signing, one of your hands will be more active than the other. This hand is your primary hand. Before beginning to sign it is a good idea to think about which hand this will be.</string>
        <string name="prim_para2">Initially it can be difficult to decide which hand to use, you should use whichever hand feels most comfortable. Most people will use the same hand that they write with. Once you have chosen your primary
            hand you should then stick to using that hand as your primary hand. If you keep on swapping while signing, it can get difficult for people to read you. Each time you learn a sign you must think about which hand you are using.</string>
        <string name="prim_para3"><b>Please note</b>: this version of the Signify app only shows signs from a right hand perspective.</string>

        <string name="man_alpha_title">The Manual Alphabet</string>
        <string name="man_alpha_info1">Each letter of a manual alphabet is represented by a different hand shape or hand movement.
        Manual alphabets are used in sign language where a sign does not exist for a word, or when a signer does not know the sign for a particular word.</string>
        <string name="man_alpha_info2"> The most common use of the manual alphabet in sign language is for names of people and places that have not had a sign assigned to them.
        In BSL, the two handed manual alphabet is used. Some sign languages use a one handed alphabet (e.g. American Sign Language and Irish Sign Language).</string>

        <string name="man_alpha_info3">A quick tip before you learn the two handed alphabet; remember that the five fingers (on your secondary hand) represent the five Vowels:</string>
        <string name="bsl_alpha_info">Below is a video of the two handed manual alphabet (right handed). As with all of the signs shown, you should learn to read and sign them. Practice your signing in front of a mirror to ensure you are not making any mistakes.

        <string name="Intro_title_six">Summary</string>
        <string name="Intro_para">In this lesson you will be learning how to start putting signs
            together to make phrases that you will be able to use in conversation with other BSL users.
            We will start with some simple single sign phrases:</string>
        <string name="Hello">Hello</string>
        <string name="Bye">Bye</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_two">When you get the chance to watch someone signing try to be
            aware of the context of signs being used; even if you are unable to follow the whole conversation
            this can be really helpful for picking out the meanings of key signs.</string>
        <string name="good">I am feeling good</string>
        <string name="not_good">I am not feeling good</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_three">Did you notice how the sign for I am feeling good involved a sign with
            your thumb extended? Likewise the sign for Im not feeling good involved extended little fingers.
            This is a common feature of BSL where a thumbs up is often used to show something as positive or
            good and the little fingers are used to show something negative or bad. This is not true all of the
            time but as a general rule is something to keep your eye out for.</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_four">Facial expression is used all of the time in sign language. It is facial
            expression that allows BSL to be such a dynamic, expressive, multi-dimensional language. As you begin
            to use sign language more and more you will soon discover that facial expression can completely change
            the meaning of a sign. The two signs how are you? and I am feeling good both contain the same hand
            movement however it is the signers facial expression that defines them (as well as context). By raising
            your eyebrows and showing a questioning facial expression you are changing the sign from I am feeling good
            to how are you? (or more literally, are you feeling good?).</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_five">When you are reading a signer you should mostly be focusing on their face rather than
            the hands. This is because the subtleties of the language are found in the facial expression (and body language).
            If you are watching the hands you may get completely the wrong message because you missed the facial expression.
            It is also easier to communicate with somebody when you have eye contact.</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_six">If you have ever spent any time watching somebody signing, or have seen BSL interpreters
            translating television programmes, you have probably noticed how body language is a very important part of this language.
            Just as with facial expression, body language can add emphasis to a sign or even change its meaning completely. This can
            be seen when you compare the signs I am feeling good and I am not feeling good. By leaning forward a little, slouching your
            shoulders, and slightly puffing your cheeks for I am not feeling good you can give the message that you are feeling really terrible,
            you can vary your body language, as you can with your facial expression, to change the meaning of the sign to suit the message that
            you want to sign.</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_seven">People often think that lip-reading and sign language are two completely different methods of communication
            but this is not true. In British Sign Language lip patterns are used to give an extra clue and to confirm the meaning of some signs.
            Once you become more proficient at signing you will become familiar with which signs require lip patterns and which ones do not.</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_eight">Lip-reading is especially important when you have a sign that has got more than one meaning. This can be
            illustrated with the signs please, and thank you. Although both signs have the same hand movement, they can be distinguished by their
            different lip patterns. This is easy to read because of the different number of syllables in the two words. Of course context would also
            play a major factor in this.</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_nine">You should be getting the picture by now that sign language is so much more than just a series of hand signals. 
            British Sign Language is a very expressive, dynamic, and free flowing language in which facial expression and body language are just as 
            important as the signs themselves. To sign without facial expression and good body language is similar to speaking with a very dull monotone voice.</string>
        <string name="Intro_para_ten">The term that is used to group facial expression and body language is <b>non-manual features</b>. Because signing requires the use of 
            non-manual features much more than spoken languages do, it is important that you really practice them so that they become more natural to use. </string>
        <string name="Intro_para_eleven">Try sitting in front of a mirror and see how many different facial expressions you can come up with. Another good way to
            practice your non-manual features is by playing charades. Non-manual features may be difficult for some people initially but the more you use them the
            easier they will become.</string>
